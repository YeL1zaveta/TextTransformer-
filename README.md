# TextTransformer-
## Description
The project implements tree classic encryption algorithms:

1.Monoalphabetic Cipher - Each letter of the alphabet is replaced with another letter according to a fixed monoalphabetic key.

2.Caesar Cipher - Each letter of the plaintext is shifted a specified number of places in the alphabet.

3.Affine Cipher - Uses the equation E(x) = (a * x + b) % m, where a and b are keys, x is the letter index, and m is the length of the alphabet (26).

## Usage:
After running the aplication,you will see the main menu,which allows to perfom various operation:
1.CESAR CHIPER

2.MONOALPHABEIC CHIPER

3.AFFINE CHIPER

4.EXIT
